# Getting started

A few easy steps to set up a project:

* Make sure you've got **Node** installed, preferably version above **10**
* Run `npm install` from project root

Most useful scripts for development:

* `npm start` - starts the project in a development mode
* `npm test` - fires up Jest test runner

Other scripts which could be helpful:

* `npm run start:build` -  starts a production version of app locally
* `npm run test:ci` - fires up Jest test runner with code coverage
* `npm run test:update` - updates all tests' snapshots from scratch
* `npm run format` - formats whole codebase with prettier
